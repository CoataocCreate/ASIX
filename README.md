# ASIX
The Asix Graphics Library

## Introduction
Asix is a 2d python library build on top pygame engine its fully support pygame methods in its Core and also some methods of asix work with pygame
methods are simple but powerfull

## Version : Asix 7.8

## Install
Run `pip install asix`

### Core
Core is the main Object of Screen and contains all methods you can use it like :

`var = Core(width, height, flags)`

its take `width` of screen and take `height` of screen
and last flags so flags are like special effects we can put on window and rendering 
flags are `borderless` makes screen without any border title buttons 
`resizeable` makes screen resizeable and `optimize` 
is a perfomance enchancer
! important to note `optimize` or `optimized` flag may not work on all devices and cause proformance issue like on gpu its only hardware accelarate

### Core Built-in's

#### @once
this is a decorator that make a function only run once no matter what in a loop no only run once 
and you can put it on any function

#### avents
this function return access to event all of pygame like:
```python
while True:
    for event in avents():
       if event.type == QUIT:
          sys.exit()
```
its same like pygame just for event in avents()

#### polygon

this function draw on points like for traingle we need 3 points 
this function points not flipped like pygame.draw.polygon have unside down points
its auto correct them like 
```
points = [(100, 100), (200, 100), (150, 200)]
core.polygon(color, points)
```
Draws a Triangle

#### globe

this function used to create circles its have multiple args 
```python
def globe(
    x: Any,
    y: Any,
    radius: Any,
    fill_color: Any,
    border_color: Any | None = None,
    border_width: int = 0
) -> None
```
its takes x-pos and y-pos and radius means size of circles and fill_color means color of circle 
and border_color means border color of circle 
and border_width of circle like

```
core.globe(100, 100, 70, (255, 255, 255), (r, g ,b), 10)

!Note If you dont want border skip border_color and border_width args
```

#### blit :
blit used for drawing images in mainloop like :

```
core.blit(*args)
```
works like pygame one like a surface and img or just img with x, y

#### key / K
the key is a function that we can use with K to written very short input management script like 
```
# init it ! Optional
ky = key()

# Use K for Keys and ky for Detection of that key like
if key[K("W")]
  print('pressed W')
  ...

...
```
or can use without init like `key()[K('W')]: ...`

#### text
text function is a basic text renderer like 
```
core.text(size, color, text, x, y, font_type: optional, rotation: require a angle var)
```
its just print that text in window

---

### Core Methods

#### color :

color is a function that sets color of the window like
```
core.color(r, g, b)
```

#### flip :

flip is a function that flips the screen like 
```
core.flip()
```

#### caption
used to set window title like
```
core.caption(str)
```

#### icon
used to set window icon like 
```
core.icon(loaded_img)
```

#### Font
this function used to make simple font like :
```
newfont = core.Font(fontpath=None, size)
```
if you want custom font .ttf or .otf do like this
```
# add your font path and create a font object
newfont = core.Font(fontpath="myfont.ttf", size)

# use that font to render text
text = newfont.render("Hello, Asix!", True, color(r, g, b))

# get its rect and Set up the position for the text
text_rect = text.get_rect(center=(400, 300))

# now draw it with core.blit
core.blit(text, text_rect)
```
thats it

---

### Additional Methods
these methods can get called direct without `core.`

#### sic :
sic is a sin cos tan calcultion function its structure 
```python
def sic(center:int, radius:int, angle:int, typ:str, startmul:int=0, endmul:int=0):
          if typ == 's':
           return center + radius * sin(angle)
          if typ == 'c':
           return center + radius * cos(angle)
          if typ == 't':
           return center + radius * tan(angle)
```
its can be used for examples :

a circle moving in a circle
```
from asix import *

_ = Core(600, 600, 'optimize')

angle = 0

while True:
    _.quit('esc')
    _.color(0, 0, 0)

    _.globe(sic(300, 100, angle, 'c'), sic(300, 100, angle, 's'), 70, (255, 255, 255))

    angle += 0.001

    _.flip()

_.exit()
```
its just calculate the radius x, y of a circle and have arg selector 's' for sin and 'c' for cos and 't' for tan

#### pie
in asix pie is math pi/pie function
```
angle += pie / 60
```

#### iload 
iload loads an image like
```
img = iload(path)
```

#### isize
isize resize a loaded img like 
```
isize(img, width, height)
```
or can be used with iload mentioned before
```
img = isize(iload(path), width, height)
```

basic structure
```
from asix import *

_ = Core(800, 600, 'optimized')

while True:
    _.quit('esc')
    _.color(250, 250, 250)
 

    _.flip()

_.exit()
```

# Easter Eggs 🎊

### Screenshot
used to get a pic of window 
```
def screenshot(surface: pygame.Surface, filename: str = 'screenshot.png') -> None:
```
no `core.` required

## Note From Developer
i removed them in latest version because if we make it look good its have no power if its complex and no power its not useless if it simple and powerfull then its good
i am trying to find a balance between power and simple
